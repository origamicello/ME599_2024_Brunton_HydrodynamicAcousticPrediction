# ME599_2024_Brunton_HydrodynamicAcousticPrediction
Masters project for ME599. Prediction of acoustic response using methods such as DMD and ERA

Currently this repo contains Python and Matlab code of our various attempts at creating ERA and DMD models of our test data inp_lock_offset.txt. As our project continues we will improve our organization and documentation of each individual file. Currently, we have found the most success with creating an ERA model, found under ERA_DMD > Acoustic_ERA.m
