# ME599_2024_Brunton_HydrodynamicAcousticPrediction

## Introduction
This project is part of the ME599 course and focuses on predicting underwater acoustic pressure levels using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) models. These methods are applied to hydrodynamic data to model acoustic responses.

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and training data used for creating DMD and ERA models that simulate underwater acoustic pressure levels. The project is structured as follows:
* The data folder contains the datasets used for training the models.
* The DMD folder contains the scripts and functions related to the Dynamic Mode Decomposition model.
* The ERA folder contains the scripts and functions related to the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm model.
